1)	In one or two sentences explain why the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements?
The number of days entered would be 10. The condition of rage is between 3 and 10 for number of days.
2)	In two or three sentences explain the advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays?
Matching arrays are very organized and simple to understand the datas.
Matching arrays store the elements in consecutive memory so it is difficult to add and delete the data.
3)Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why
It was hard. I hope that we learn more examples of making codes for our workshop during the lecture(monday class) instead of just listing powerpoint which already on IPC144 website. When I work on IPC144 workshop, most of time I have to learn by myself to search the google or youtube in order to learn how to make codes.
For example, I didnâ€™t learn how to create codes for highest value or lowest value using array from IPC144 class. I learned about syntax of C language from the class. However, learning only syntax is not enough doing workshop on time by myself.
