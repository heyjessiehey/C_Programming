1- What do think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop?
	The most important thing I learned is that making code using the type 'while'. 
2- Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing?
	On my matrix, calculating the GST shows that 1.12. 
	It supposed to be 1.13 by rounding up from 1.1284(8.68*.13).
3- What is the result of a casting operation?
	The result of a cating operation is that I used Float instead of Double so, the outcome became Float where I used a casting operation. Also, I saved memory using Float instead of Double. 
4- Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?
	Using the modulus operator needs to use selection construct which is 'If' instead of using iteration construct which is 'While'. 
	Therefore, I can practice to use both constructs in my codes.
